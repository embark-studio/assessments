# Node.js API Evaluation Test Thing

## Description
Create a REST API that in Node.js allows for listing, creating, modifying, and deleting books.  Please do not use a node.js
framework like Sails or Trails.

Each book has a title and an author.

You should protect your library; only authenticated users should be allowed to modify information, but anyone can look at
what books are in your library.

## Details
* You don't need to actually use a real databse, memory is fine.  Make sure it'd be easy to modify in the future, though.
* For the purpose of this evaluation, putting credential information in the code itself is fine.
